Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! This repository serves as a collection of my practice code and projects as I delve into the world of JavaScript.

About
In this repository, you will find a variety of JavaScript exercises, small projects, and code snippets that demonstrate my progress and understanding of JavaScript concepts. I am using this space to document my learning process and share my code with fellow learners and developers.

Contents
The repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific topic or project. Here's an overview of the main directories:

Basics: This directory contains simple JavaScript code snippets that cover fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control flow.

Functions: Here, you'll find examples of JavaScript functions, including function declarations, arrow functions, higher-order functions, and more.

DOM Manipulation: This directory explores JavaScript's interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM) and showcases how to manipulate web page elements dynamically.

Projects: In this directory, I showcase small JavaScript projects that apply the concepts I've learned. Each project has its own folder and README file for further details.
